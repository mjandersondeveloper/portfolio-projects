Find All Centrums (HW4)

Algorithm:
	- Given G = (V, E)
	- Run G through the SCC algorithm
	- Once complete, using the DAG metagraph out, G_m, form the SCC algorithm:
		- Using the strongly connected component with the highest ccnum (source SCC), run the Explore algorithm from a vertex, v, within that strongly connected component.
		- For each u in G, if all visted(u)=true, add all verticies that have the same ccnum to the candidate set.
	- Return the candidate set

Correctness:
	- By using the SCC algorithm as a blackbox, we can use the resulting DAG metagraph to see which set of verticies are within strongly connected components
	- The vertex with the highest ccnum is guarenteed to be a source SCC
	- Finally, running Explore from a vertex w/ the source SCC to check if all verticies within G are visited proves that all vertices in the source SCC are centrums

Runtime:
	- Running the SCC algorithm takes O(n + m) time
	- Running Explore from a vertex, v, within the source SC takes O(n + m) time
	- Overall runtime is O(m +n)
