K-th Quantiles (HW3)

- Input: Set S of distance numbers and value of k
- k is a power of 2
- Split set S into k subsets of the same size
- S is NOT sorted
- Output: The k-th quantiles (k-1) of a set S of n numbers

Algorithm: Fastselect
- Let i = n/k
- Find the median of S using Fastselect (S, n/2). Add number to the result set
- Partition S into S_l and S_r side using the median.
- Repeat step number 1 against S_l and S_r, finding the median of each subset, adding those numbers to the result set.
- Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the size of the subset = i.
- Return result set

Correctness:
- Fastselect as a blackbox finds the median value of the set.
- Each partition can be divided by its median and b/c k is a power of 2 and n is a multiple of k, we can strictly partition until we get to the base case.

Runtime:
- Fastselect takes O(n) time.
- Partitioning takes O(log k) time.
- Overall runtime is O (n log k).
