K-Honest SAT (Exam 3)

NP Proof:
We can verify the solution to KHSAT by traversing the CNF formula input and verifying if at least k amount of variables are set to true, as well as, if f is satisfiable. This can be done in O(nm) time as we need to traverse n-literals within m-clauses, which is in polynomial time.

NP Complete Proof:

Reduction: SAT -> K-Honest-SAT (KHSAT)

I.T.:
- Given CNF input f
- Add one variable, x, set to true and an additional clause. Set k = 1, f'.
	- Ex: (f) ^ (x)
- Pass f' and k into KHSAT

O.T.:
- Return NO, if KHSAT returns NO
- Return S of KHSAT, dropping the newly added x-variable and assigning the renaming variable assignments to f.

Correctness:
- Adding one clause that can only be satisfied if the variable is set to true. Therefore, if KHSAT returns a solution, the original CNF must be satisfiable.
- If the original CNF is satisfiable, there must be a solution to KHSAT with at least one variable equal to true.
