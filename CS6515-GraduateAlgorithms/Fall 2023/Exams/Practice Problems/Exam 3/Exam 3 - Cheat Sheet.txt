Exam 3 - Cheat Sheet

Linear Programming Notes:
Max (<=)
Min (=>)

Dual transformation:
c.A.b 
Ay=><=c

UB -> I (Primal -> Dual)
I <- UB (Primal <- Dual)


NP Notes:

SAT -> 3SAT -> IS -> Clique & VC
            -> SS -> Knapsack

A -> B reduction

I.S. - (x, y) vertices pairs w/ no edges in b/w them - O(n^2)
Clique - (x, y) vertices pairs w/ edges in b/w them - O(n^2)
V.C. - (x, y) with edges where x in subset S, and y in subset S
S.S. - Combination of integer values add up to a goal total, t - O(n log t)
SAT - n-literal, m-clauses. O(nm) time for unknown # of literals, O(m) for known # of literals (3SAT).
