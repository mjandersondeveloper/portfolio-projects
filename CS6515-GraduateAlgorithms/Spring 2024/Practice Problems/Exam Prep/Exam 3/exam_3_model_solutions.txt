K-Almost SAT
------------
NP Proof:
- Given candidate solution, S
	- Go through the clauses of f making sure that exactly m - k clauses are satisfied in O(mn) time.

NP Complete Proof:

Reduction: SAT -> K-Almost SAT (KASAT)

I.T.:
- Given formula f as input to SAT.
- Create f' = (f) ^ (a) ^ (!a) and set k=1 in O(1) time.
- Pass f' and k into KASAT in O(1) time.

O.T.:
- Given solution, S, remove the truth assignment for the added variable in O(n) time.
- Given NO solution, return NO in O(1) time.

Correctness:
- If KASAT finds a solution, then f must be satisfiable b/c exactly one clause is allowed to be false and we added it.
- If KASAT reports NO, then > 1 clause must be false and that has to come from the original f boolean formula.

Pinwheel
--------
NP Proof:
- Given a set of vertices, S
	- Check that |S| = k + 1 in O(n) time
	- Check in G that one vertex in S connects to all other vertices in S
	- Check that no other pair in S has an edge b/w them
	- Both take O(n^2) time
		- (Inducing/degree checks works here too btw)

NP Complete Proof:

Reduction: I.S. -> Pinwheel

I.T.:
- Given graph G from I.S.
- Create G' by adding one vertex, v, and an edge from v to every vertex in G in O(n) time.
- Pass G' and k into Pinwheel in O(1) time.

O.T.:
- Given NO solution to Pinwheel, report NO.
- Given a solution to Pinwheel, find and remove the center vertex which connects to all other vertices, resulting in an independent set of vertices in O(n + m).

Correctness:
- We have added one vertex with a connection to all others. If a Pinwheel exists, the outer vertices must come from the original graph. Since they have no common edges, they define the independent set of |S| = k.
- If there's no solution to Pinwheel, since we added the required center vertex, there can't be k-vertices in G w/o common edges.
