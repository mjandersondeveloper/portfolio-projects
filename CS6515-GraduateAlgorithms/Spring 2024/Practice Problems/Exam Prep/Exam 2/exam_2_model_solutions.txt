One Edge SCC
------------

Algorithm:
- Run SCC, returning metagrpah og G, G_m.
- Find the sinks of G and sources of G_m.
- If there are more than one sink or source, report NO.
- If there is a single SCC, the graph is already storngly connected.
- Otherwise, add one edge from a vertex in the sink SCC to a vertex in the source SCC to make G strongly connected.

Correctness:
- Graph must contain a single sink and single source.
- Adding an edge from the sink to the source makes G an SCC.

Runtime:
- Overall runtime is O(n + m).

Central Highway
---------------

Algorithm:
- Call the modified edge, e.
- If the new toll cost(e) is less than the current toll, there are no changes to the Central Highway (C.H).
- If the new toll cost(e) is higher:
	- Remove e from C.H. MST.
	- Run DFS on the modified MST, yielding two connected components.
	- Traverse the edges of G and find the edge of minimum weight which spans the cut. (u,v) such that ccnum[u] != ccnum[v].
	- Add that edge highway to the C.H.

Correctness:
- Assert the Cut Property.

Runtime:
- Overall runtime is O(n + m).
